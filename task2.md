# Improve Create Project Flow (Vue)

- After installation vue project, I want to run the following command more

```cmd
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm run build
```

- Don't asking to run "npm run lint"
- Don't create any unnecessary markdown files. 
- Don't asking to write tests or run build 
- Optimize the code for better performance and readability.
