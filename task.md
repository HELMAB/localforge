# Improve Manage PHP

I want to improve the PHP in "Manage Services" tab.

## Proposed Enhancement

- Cache the php list into local storage to avoid fetching it every time the command is run.
- Move "Install New Version" button to header but the right side for better visibility.
    - When clicked, it should open a modal
    - Display output of installation process in the modal
- Make sure the php list is refreshed after a new installation.
- Check PHP selection dropdown to fetch data from local storage.
- Remove "Install new version" section
- Don't asking to run "npm run lint"
- Don't create any unnecessary markdown files.
- Don't asking to write tests or run build
- Optimize the code for better performance and readability.

## Proposed Enhancement 2

- Background color, border color, button color isn't matching with the PHP theme. Please Update the colors to match the PHP theme.
- Improve UI in the dark mode
- Don't asking to run "npm run lint"
- Don't create any unnecessary markdown files.
- Don't asking to write tests or run build
- Optimize the code for better performance and readability.
